I made this project to learn more about computer vision, neural networks, and the full ML workflow loading data, building and training a model, and evaluating how well it works.

I chose the CIFAR-10 dataset because itâ€™s a classic example and a lot of companies recognize it. Doing this project helped me get more comfortable with image classification and model evaluation.

You can see the training loss plotted over time, and the test accuracy gives a quick sense of how well the model does on new images.
